        <h4>About</h4>
        <h3>Winnipeg, the heart of the continent</h3>
        <p>
          Winnipeg lies at the confluence of the Assiniboine and the Red River
          of the North, a location now known as "the Forks." This point was at
          the crossroads of canoe routes travelled by First Nations before
          European contact.
        </p>
        <p>
          The region was a trading centre for Indigenous peoples long before the
          arrival of Europeans; it is the traditional territory of the
          Anishinabe (Ojibway), Ininew (Cree), Oji-Cree, Dene, and Dakota, and
          is the birthplace of the Métis Nation.
